I'm his song when he feels like singin'
And I swing when he feels like swingin'

I don't know what I'd do that's right
But it makes him come home at night
And when he's home, I make sure he's never alone
And that's why I keep singin' my song

And when he's home, I make sure he's never alone
And that's why I keep
I keep on
Yes, I keep
Just keep on
Oh, I just keep singin' my song

My song
