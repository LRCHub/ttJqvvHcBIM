You know you're always here in my heart
From the break of dawn 'till deep in the dark
When times are bringing me down
I just want you around
'Cause you're making me feel so right

You're the wind in my trees
You're the one (you're the one)

You're the rhythm of my song, so tight
My tune to sing along, day and night
Full of harmony like a symphony
Only you can make me feel so strong
You're the rhythm of my song

Now we're together in a beautiful plan
And you're the music that's making me dance
Now baby come what may
We'll never lose our way
"Cause together our direction is right

You're the wind in my trees
You're the one (you're the one) you're the one

You're the rhythm of my song, so tight
My tune to sing along, day and night
Full of harmony like a symphony
Only you can make me feel so strong
You're the rhythm of my song

Cont'd...

Oh, there'll come a time our feelings may change
Still it's alright 'cause something remains
The rhythm of life keeps alive, keeps love alive

You're the wind in my trees
You're the one (you're the one) you're the one

You're the rhythm of my song, so tight
My tune to sing along, day and night
Full of harmony like a symphony
Only you can make me feel so strong
You're the rhythm of my song

Repeat chorus to fade
