I Sing My Song
G.Kooymans

Through the windy foggy weather
I'll come to you no matter
How long it will take
Then I'll sing you mellow songs
About times, how it was
How we drifted upon our love

Oh I sing my song, on and on
And take you with me
In a dreamy course
I sing my song, on and on
And take you with me
No one can change our course

And you lead softly to faraway
Where seldom a glimpse will play
And then suddenly we'll fling away

There's a burning thing called fire
Makes my heart desire
So I sing my song to you
There's a burning thing called fire
Makes my heart desire
So I sing my song, on and on

So I'll sing you mellow songs
About times, how it was
How we drifted upon our love
We were floating on silver water
To find rainbows, cutting hearts
Oh, in the trees

Oh I sing my song, on and on
And take you with me
In a dreamy course
I sing my song, on and on
And take you with me
No one can change our course

And you lead softly to faraway
Where seldom a glimpse will play
And then suddenly we'll fling away

There's a burning thing called fire
Makes my heart desire
So I sing my song to you
There's a burning thing called fire
Makes my heart desire
So I sing my song, on and on

There's a burning thing called fire
Makes my heart desire
So I sing my song on and on... to take you with me. on fire...

There's a burning thing called fire
Makes my heart desire
So I sing my on and on.
